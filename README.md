# Prediction-of-Used-car-Prices
Implementation

To begin our analysis, we use a dataset from Kaggle that includes various features influencing used car prices. A methodology based on CRISP-DM is developed. There are two approaches to solving this problem, both of which have been tested and explained. Exploration of demand for cars across different states in the U.S., noting the average prices of cars with respect to the considered influencing features. Scaling variables can impact the output and make interpretation difficult, but we finalize a machine-learning model to move forward with deployment. After comparing results, we find that the XG Boost algorithm is the best prediction model for this dataset, followed by the Random Forest Regressor. The model's output has $3098.716 as RMSE and an R-square of 82.08%.
