Dissertation in my masters. Dataset is procured from Kaggle and the dataset has used car prices from Craigslist Website. It is an online advertising company in the U.S. Using regression analysis, XG Boost turned out to be the best model and prices are predicted. On this dataset, scaled and unscaled data results are also compared.
